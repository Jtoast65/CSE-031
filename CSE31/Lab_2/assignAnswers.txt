Assignment 1
1.Line 22 caused the segmentation fault. The line reads scanf("%d", input).  
The address is supposed to pass the addrress but there is no address to be passed.
2. To fix it to work properly you change the sum integer to a pointer, this creates an address
that can be passed and dereferenced.
3. The value of the sum variable wasn't being dereffernced so the value could no update.
4. To fix it you dereference the pointer and pass the address of the sum.
Assignment 2
1. Yes the output is expected.
2. The output is not exptected. The bug in the program is that the in str2 stays
and is added to the next string.  The origninal string should be deleted.
3. The output is ot expected.  I think this happens becuase of the spaces in the string.  The spaces might make it read each word as a new string or only the back half of it.
