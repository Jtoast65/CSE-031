TPS 3:
1. There is 4 variables and two pointers declared.
2. X and Y will return nothing and arr[0] will return a garbage value.
3. You can prevent that by assigning integers to each variable.
8. Yes the address makes sense because the name of the array points to arr[0].  Arr[0] address and the address of the array are the same.
