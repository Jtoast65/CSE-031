while "input is not 0"
    print enter value
    ask for input
make an array
while input is not 0
    make interger that is equaal to input mod 10
    put integer in th array
    divide the input by 10 

make a for loop to loop through the array 
add each component of the array up 
store that in an a variable and determine if the variable is either even or odd with mod 2 
if the thing is even store in even then the even count is plus 1 and if odd odd count plus one
store the even and odd numbers in an array 
take the array and add each one up and then take that number and divide it by the count for either even or odd 
and then print it all out
