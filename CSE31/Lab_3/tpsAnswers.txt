TPS 2:
1. The code defines a structure for a linked list node containing an integer and a float value.
It also allocates memory for a single node and it initilaizes its values.
2. value of head is adresss in stack, and the addresses of the rest are in the heap.
3. The members of the node structure are stored one after the other.
Head pointer points to the beginning of the block allocated for the Node structre.
Offset between the address of the structure members corresponds to their respective sizes.

The relationship between the head pointer and its destination, is that head points to the memory location wehre the Node is stored.
