TPS 1:
1. It should print out 2.
2. Expect to print 42 43 41 
4. It printed out 2. I was surprised by the results
 because I expected it to print out in hex format.
5. 
a. 2 arrays were allocated.
b. They are both pointing to the same location.

6. The difference is that the last int holds 44 43 42 41.
10. C accesses the biggest amount of memory first and then accesses the rest of the memory.

TPS 2:
1. Line 8 makes an array of pointers that point to integers
2. *(arr+i)
3. *(*(arr+i)+j)
4. We have to pass the array because we don't know its size.
